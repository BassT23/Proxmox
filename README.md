**IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, I HOPE YOU HAVE BACKUPS FROM YOUR MACHINES!**

**YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!**

</div>

### What does the script do:
- The script makes system updates with apt/dnf/pacman/apk or yum on all nodes/LXCs and VMs (if VMs prepared for that)
- Make a snapshot before update (if your storage support it - [look here](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Storage)). If not supported, you can choose to make a real backup, but this must be enabled in `update.conf` by user (take long time!)
- After all, the updater makes a little cleaning (like `apt autoremove`) 
- If the script detects "extra" installations, it could update this also. Look in config file, for that.
- NEW: use your own scripts during update if you like. [Look here](https://github.com/BassT23/Proxmox/tree/develop#user-scripts)

### Features:
- Update Proxmox VE (the host / all cluster nodes / all included LXCs and VMs)
- Snapshot / Backup support (for Snapshot, your system must prepared for it)
- Normal run is "Interactive" / Headless Mode can be run with `update -s`
- Logging - location can be change in config file
- Exit tracking, so you can send additional commands for finish or failure (edit files in `/etc/ultimate-updater/exit`)
- [Config file](https://github.com/BassT23/Proxmox/tree/master#config-file)
- Trim filesystem on ext4 nodes - 

Info can be found with `update -h`

Changelog: [here](https://github.com/BassT23/Proxmox/blob/master/change.log)

## 
# Installation:
In Proxmox GUI Host Shell or as root on proxmox host terminal:
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BassT23/Proxmox/master/install.sh)
```

# Usage:
 - If you want to run the updater globally for all nodes/lxc/vm only run `update`
 - If you want to update only one specific lxc/vm run `update <ID>`

##
## Cluster-Mode preparation:
**! For Cluster Installation, you only need to install on one Host !**

The nodes need to know each other. For that please edit the `/etc/hosts` file on each node. Otherwise, you can use the GUI. (NODE -> System -> Hosts)

Example add:
```
192.168.1.10   pve1
192.168.1.11   pve2
192.168.1.12   pve3
...
```
IP and Name must match with node ip and its hostname.
- IP can be found in node terminal with `hostname -I`
- hostname can be found in node terminal with `hostname`

After that make the fingerprints.
The used sequence can be check, if you run `awk '/ring0_addr/{print $2}' "/etc/corosync/corosync.conf"` from the host, on which Proxmox-Updater is installed.
So connect from first node (on which you install the Proxmox-Updater) to node2 with `ssh pve2`. Then from node2 `ssh pve3`, and so on.

## If you want to update the VMs also, you have two choices:
1. Use the "light and easy" QEMU option

     more infos here: [QEMU Guest Agent](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Qemu-guest-agent)

2. Use ssh connection with Key-Based Authentication (a little more work, but nicer output and "extra" support)

     more infos here: [SSH Connection](https://github.com/BassT23/Proxmox/blob/master/ssh.md)

# Update the script:
`update -up`

If update run into issue, please remove first with:
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BassT23/Proxmox/master/install.sh) uninstall
```
and install new

# Config File:
The config file is stored under `/etc/ultimate-updater/update.conf`

With this file, you can manage the updater. For example; if you don't want to update PiHole, comment the line out with #, or change `true` to `false`.

- Host / LXC / VM
- Headless Mode
- Extra updates
- "stopped" or "running" LXC/VM
- "only" or "exclude" LXC/VM by ID

# Extra Updates:
If updater detects installation: (disable, if you want in `/etc/ultimate-updater/update.conf`)
- PiHole
- ioBroker
- Pterodactyl
- Octoprint
- Docker Compose (v1 and v2)

# User scripts:
How to use user scripts:

In "/etc/ultimate-updater/scripts.d" create an folder for each LXC/VM who should use it like this:
(000 is the example ID)

/etc/ultimate-updater/scripts.d/000/

here you can put in any script you like, which will be run during update also.
!!! DON'T use free spaces in file name !!! ("file 1.sh" -> "file-1.sh")

these files are used in the "extra update" section at the end of the LXC/VM

# Welcome Screen:
The Welcome Screen is an extra for you. It's optional!

- The Welcome-Screen brings an update-checker with it. It check on 07am and 07pm for updates via crontab. The result will show up in Welcome-Screen (Only if updates are available).
- The update-checker also uses the config file!
- To force the check, you can run `/etc/ultimate-updater/check-updates.sh` in Terminal.
- You can choose, if neofetch will be show also (if neofetch is not installed, script will make it automatically)

# Beta Testing:
If anybody wants to help with failure search, please test our beta (if available).

Install beta update with `update beta -up`
To go back to master, choose `update -up`
